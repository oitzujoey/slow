Either I can use an actual database, or I can write my own. A library is fast and saves me some code, but I'm unsure if I will be able to find one with the type system I want.
All code is stored as source. Source != source text; Source == AST.
Typing is strong but dynamic. Assignment is only allowed to occur if the type of the destination matches the source.
Type checking is done at both compile time and runtime.

Basic data types:
  function — Always curried.
  macro — I think I can make these first class. Always curried.
  number — GMP?
  sequence — array

A dump of memory is available at any time.
Execution can be stopped at any time.
